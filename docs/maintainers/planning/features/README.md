# Feature Planning Hub

**Purpose:** Feature-based planning and tracking using hub-and-spoke documentation  
**Status:** ✅ Active  
**Last Updated:** [Date]

## 🎯 Overview

Feature planning organizes development work around user-facing functionality. Each feature has its own directory with hub-and-spoke documentation for clear navigation and focused content.

### Feature Planning Philosophy

1. **User-Centric** - Features solve real user problems
2. **Hub-and-Spoke** - Clear entry points with detailed documentation
3. **Task-Group Based** - Break features into manageable task groups
4. **Status Tracking** - Consistent progress monitoring
5. **Fix Integration** - Troubleshooting documentation included

## 🎨 Feature Development Pattern

### 1. Feature Discovery

- Identify user problem or opportunity
- Create feature directory
- Run `/explore` and `/research` for investigation

### 2. Planning

- Create ADRs with `/decision` for key decisions
- Generate plan with `/transition-plan` (creates `implementation-plan.md` + `tasks/`)
- Review plan with `/plan-review`
- Set up status tracking

### 3. Implementation

- Execute tasks sequentially with `/task next`
- Update status documents as groups complete
- Document decisions and learnings
- Create fix documentation as needed

### 4. Completion

- Document results and metrics
- Archive superseded documents
- Update project roadmap
- Share lessons learned

## 📊 Feature Status Overview

### ✅ Completed Features

| Feature     | Status      | Duration | Result    |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| [Feature 1] | ✅ Complete | X days   | [Summary] |

### 🟠 In Progress Features

| Feature     | Current Group | Progress | Next        |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| [Feature 1] | Group 2       | 5/12     | [Next step] |

### 🟡 Planned Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Creating a New Feature

1. **Create Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p features/[feature-name]/tasks
   cd features/[feature-name]
   ```

2. **Generate Plan**

   Use `/transition-plan` to scaffold the plan automatically, or create manually:
   - `implementation-plan.md` — Task index with YAML frontmatter
   - `status-and-next-steps.md` — Progress tracking
   - `tasks/01-group-name.md` — Task group files

3. **Customize Content**

   - Update feature description and goals
   - Define success criteria
   - Break into task groups
   - Set up status tracking

4. **Link to Hub**
   - Add feature to `features/README.md`
   - Update project roadmap
   - Create initial status document

### Feature Planning Checklist
